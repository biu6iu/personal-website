# Steven's Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! It includes an about page that details my education, skills and experience, a project page that showcases the projects I've worked on, and a contacts page to reach me. I also have a photography page that displays some photos I've taken.

## Tech Stack
This project was originally built on purely HTML/CSS, and now I'm in the middle of transitioning it into TypeScript for better functionality. I'm also planning to implement a NoSQL database in order to store the photos, which will most likely be MongoDB. 

## Photography Collections

- Sydney, Australia
- ChongQing, ShenZhen, and HongKong
- Fitzroy, Melbourne
- Beijing, China
- Raglan, New Zealand
- Archives (pre 2023)
