# Photography Portfolio

My photography portfolio built with TypeScript and Vite. However, I'm looking to transfer this into more of a personal portfolio. 


## Collections

- Sydney, Australia
- ChongQing, ShenZhen, and HongKong
- Fitzroy, Melbourne
- Beijing, China
- Raglan, New Zealand
- Archives (pre 2023)


## Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
